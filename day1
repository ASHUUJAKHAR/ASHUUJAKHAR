Today we install git in our linux machine.
After that i made a directory and use "git init" command for intialize this directory as my working directory.

Now i can do write my code in working dir. by using a file. In that file i can write my code.

yeah i wrote some notes in singapore region but the notes will not push on github but i will try to manage that.

Now we will discuss about how to push your code to github or central repository.
command :- git remote add origin <central repo link>
and after that :- git push origin master.
